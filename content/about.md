Martin's favorite Job was the Director of Engineering at Moz responsible for all the Big-Data teams. In his spare time, Martin enjoys the company of anybody that enjoys beer/wine and talking politics as long as they do not take either too seriously. Martin  enjoys skiing and will use up all his holiday in the winter.
